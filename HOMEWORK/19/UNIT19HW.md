## Rubric for Unit 19: Add Interactive Elements to Your Portfolio


### PART ONE: Submit Google Drive link
Should have the following: 
- A screenshot, jpg or png file of the current visual design. 
- A Gif of the animation/interaction the student designed using XD.
- A Google document containing the key insight students received from their peers.
- An updated screenshot, jpg or png file of the studentâ€™s design that has been iterated on based on the feedback they received.

### PART TWO: Provide Github Repo
Your repo should contain the following: 
- The proper folder structure for the JS assignment. Created a js folder to contain your script.
- An index.js file should be located inside.
- An event listener should be used with the .on function. Keep in mind the .on function can be used to write more than click functions. As long as the event listener is triggered by user interaction this deliverable will be complete. 

Common types of event listeners are: 
clicks.
hovers.
when a page loads.
when a user scrolls.
